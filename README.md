# ISO 20022 Templater

Commandline tool to render templates based on [ISO 20022](https://www.iso20022.org/iso-20022-message-definitions) bank statements.

Primary motivation is to get the digital bank statements of my current bank imported into [Firefly](https://www.firefly-iii.org/) using its [CSV importer](https://docs.firefly-iii.org/csv/).
